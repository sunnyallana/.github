# Contributing

We would ‚ù§Ô∏è for you to contribute to Appwrite and help make it better! We want contributing to Appwrite to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions, including issues, new docs, updated docs, blog posts, workshops, and more, are welcome.

## How to Start?

If you are worried or need help figuring out where to start, check out our next section explaining what kind of help is needed and where you can get involved. You can reach out with questions on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GSeTUeA) server. You can also submit an issue, and a maintainer can guide you!

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Appwrite open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submit a Pull Request üöÄ

Our branch naming convention is as follows:

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

Where `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message describing the changes made!**

Start by forking the project and use the `git clone` command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream to ensure your default branch is up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create a new branch from the default branch. For example `doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )
4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

6. Submit your changes for review. If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
7. Start a Pull Request (PR) by clicking on `Create pull request`. Make sure to update the PR description following the template provided.
8. Wait for a code review.
9. If you need to make changes based on feedback, re-request your reviewer's review after you've made the necessary changes.

## Introducing New Features

We would üíñ you to contribute to Appwrite, but we would also like to make sure Appwrite is as great as possible and loyal to its vision and mission statement üôè.

For us to find the right balance, please open an issue explaining your ideas before introducing a new pull request.

An issue will allow the Appwrite community to thoroughly discuss the new feature and how it fits into the product roadmap and vision.

An issue is also essential for Appwrite maintainers to discuss the feature's design and architecture to help the contribution fit in organically in the Appwrite codebase. Some more extensive features might need to go through our [RFC process](https://github.com/appwrite/rfc).
